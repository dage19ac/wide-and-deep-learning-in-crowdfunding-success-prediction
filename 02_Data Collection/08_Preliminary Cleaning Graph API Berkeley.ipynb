With the push for greener businesses, homes, and environments becoming a large issue, companies are looking for ways to reduce energy consumption and save paper. Near field communication technology takes a step in the right direction by cutting down on paper consumption for advertisements and communications.\\n\\nThough businesses still print ads to put NFC tags on, they can reduce the amount of extra paper circulated with each ad. Instead of distributing flyers for a house for sale or a clearance event, a large sign can have an NFC tag that users wave their smartphone over to get all the information they need about the event. This cuts down on the amount of material printed for an advertising campaign. This is especially important since all that paper is typically thrown away after the sale ends.'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n","[{'commitmentCategory': 'sustainable_materials', 'description': 'Kanso towels are made from bamboo fiber which needs 1/3 the water as cotton making it a much more sustainable textile.'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n","[{'commitmentCategory': 'long_lasting_design', 'description': \"I've designed my product to be durable by using high grade thermoplastic polymer and stainless steel.\"}, {'commitmentCategory': 'reusability_and_recyclability', 'description': 'I plan to implement a take-back program with backers that will bring a local youth organization in as charitable recipients of the returned putting aids.'}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n","[{'commitmentCategory': 'long_lasting_design', 'description': 'Seam produces no waste since we are a mobile application.
