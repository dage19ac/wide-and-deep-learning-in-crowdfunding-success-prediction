There are two possibilities how to retrieve the datasets that can be used for the model building:

1) When you have chosen to use the raw data and run the Python code in the folders *"02_Data Collection"* and *"03_Data Cleaning"* by yourself, the necessary datasets should be directly available in this folder.

2) When you have chosen to use the already pre-cleaned and merged datasets, click on *Releases* -> *Final Datasets Kickstarter* and download the attached CSV files.
